# Atelier 1 - Business Intelligence & Data Analytics

This repository contains the deliverables for **Atelier 1** of the **BI & Data Analytics module**. The dataset used for this workshop was based on the **Food Delivery domain**. Below is a detailed overview of the contents and purpose of each file in this repository.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Presentation**
- **`presentation_atelier1.pptx`**
  - A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.
  - Includes:
    - Project objectives.
    - Data insights.
    - Methodologies and results.

### 2. **Database**
- **`food_delivery.sql`**
  - SQL schema and data dump for the Food Delivery database.
- **`queries.sql`**
  - SQL queries developed using MySQL Workbench.
  - Purpose:
    - Extract meaningful insights from the relational database.
    - Demonstrate the ability to handle structured data effectively.

### 3. **NoSQL Implementation**
- **`mongodb_queries.ipynb`**
  - A Jupyter Notebook that includes:
    - Equivalent queries in NoSQL using MongoDB Atlas.
    - Steps for data import into MongoDB.
    - Demonstration of NoSQL operations.

### 4. **Documentation**
- **`documentation.docx`**
  - Detailed Word document explaining:
    - SQL query logic.
    - Comparisons between SQL and NoSQL approaches.
    - Observations and recommendations.

## Instructions for Use

### Prerequisites
1. **Relational Database Setup**
   - Install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
   - Import `food_delivery.csv` to set up the database.
2. **NoSQL Database Setup**
   - Create a MongoDB cluster using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Import the dataset using the steps in the `mongodb_queries.ipynb` notebook.

### Running the Queries
- **SQL Queries:**
  - Open `queries.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
  - Execute the provided queries to extract insights.
- **NoSQL Queries:**
  - Open `mongodb_queries.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
  - Follow the steps to run the NoSQL operations on MongoDB Atlas.

## Key Insights
1. **Relational Analysis:**
   - Insights derived from structured queries in SQL.
   - Examples: Top-performing restaurants, frequent delivery areas, etc.
2. **NoSQL Analysis:**
   - Flexible querying for semi-structured data.
   - Examples: Aggregations for delivery times, dynamic analysis of customer feedback.

## Summary
Atelier 1 provided hands-on experience in:
- Exploring and querying relational databases using SQL.
- Transitioning to NoSQL approaches for handling semi-structured data.
- Comparing methodologies and understanding the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL.
